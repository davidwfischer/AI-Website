    <h2>What are LLMs?</h2>
    <p>
        Large Language Models are advanced artificial intelligence models based on the Transformer architecture. They specialize in understanding and generating natural language. Through comprehensive
        Pre-trained on large amounts of unannotated text data, they can cover a wide range of linguistics
        Capture subtleties and context. The self-attention mechanism allows these models to focus on different parts of the input and capture long-range dependencies. Their versatility extends from question-and-answer systems to text generation, but there are also ethical considerations associated with their use.

    <h2>Difference</h2>
    <span>1. Artificial intelligence (AI)</span>
    <p>
        AI is a broader term that refers to the development of intelligent systems, while LLMs are specialized models
        within the AI Field that specialize in processing and generating natural language understanding. AI can
        encompass various technologies and methodologies, while LLMs focus on specific models for language processing.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Artificial intelligence refers to the development of systems that have human-like cognitive abilities or
            can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. This can cover a wide range of applications
            including machine learning, computer vision, language processing, robotics and much more.
        </li>
        <li>
            AI systems can have varying degrees of autonomy and intelligence. Some systems are designed to automate
            specific tasks, while others are capable of learning and adapting to new situations.

    <span>2. Large Language Model (LLMs)</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Large Language Models refer to a special type of AI models that are trained to understand and generate
            natural language. These models are often neural networks with a lot of parameters (hence “large”) that are
            trained on large text data sets</li>

    <h2>What can they do ?</h2>
    <p>
        These platforms are able to generate texts, answer questions, simple code fragments in
        creating different programming languages, carrying out language translations, creative writing
        Help, provide support with homework and learning requests, and act as a conversation partner.
